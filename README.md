# NWU Tech Trends Projects

Welcome to the NWU Tech Trends project repository! This repository encompasses multiple projects aimed at developing various software solutions for the consulting firm NWU Tech Trends.

## Repositories

This repository is organized into several projects, each addressing different aspects of software development:

1. **Project 1: Kanban Project**
   - **Purpose:** To plan the project, including training, classes, milestones, and labels.
   - **Repository:** `CMPG 323 Project 2 - <my student Student Number>`
     
2. **Project 2: CRUD RESTful API Development**
   - **Purpose:** To develop a CRUD RESTful API for tracking time and cost savings associated with automations.
   - **Repository:** `CMPG 323 Project 2 - <my student Student Number>`

3. **Project 3: Blazor Application Enhancement**
   - **Purpose:** To enhance an existing Blazor application, focusing on implementing coding principles and design patterns.
   - **Repository:** `CMPG 323 Project 3 - <my student Student Number>`

4. **Project 4: Robotic Process Automation (RPA) for User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**
   - **Purpose:** To automate UAT for the web application using UiPath.
   - **Repository:** `CMPG 323 Project 4 - <my student Student Number>>`

## Documentation

## Branching Strategy

Each project will follow a branching strategy to ensure organized and controlled development:

- **Main Branch:** The default branch containing the production-ready code.
- **Development Branch:** A branch for integrating features and testing.
- **Feature Branches:** Separate branches created from the development branch for individual features or tasks. Once a feature is complete, it is merged back into the development branch.

## Use of `.gitignore`

Each project will include a `.gitignore` file to prevent sensitive and unnecessary files from being committed to the repository. Commonly ignored files include:

- Configuration files with sensitive data
- Build and dependency directories (e.g., `node_modules`, `bin`, `obj`)
- Logs and temporary files

## Storage of Credentials and Sensitive Information

To ensure security, credentials and sensitive information will not be stored directly in the source code or committed to the repository. Instead, the following practices will be implemented:

- Use environment variables to store sensitive information.
- Include sample configuration files (e.g., `appsettings.example.json`) with placeholders for sensitive data.
- Ensure that the `.gitignore` file excludes actual configuration files with sensitive information.
